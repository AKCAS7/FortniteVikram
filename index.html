    <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Why I love the Game</h2>
    <p>I love this game due to its mix of building and shooting.People hold mixed opinions about this but I dont really care.<br/>
       The building aspect of fortnite is what makes the game tough to master. But people that think have a contrary view to this <br/>
       say that one should either build or shoot. The rush I feel when building and absolutely demolishing matches is one of the <br/>
       most amazing feelings I get.<br/>
       It feels very deserving to beat the opponent after building, whereas in other shooting games when you just stand there and <br/>
       shoot the other guy, I am doing the SAME THING EVERY guy in that game does.<br/>
       SO thats why I like this game so much.</p>
